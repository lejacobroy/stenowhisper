The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for this project are:

1. `AudioFile` class: Represents an audio file in the library. It should have attributes like `file_id`, `file_name`, `file_path`, `transcription_status`, etc.

2. `AudioLibrary` class: Manages the collection of audio files. It should have methods like `add_audio_file`, `get_audio_file`, `get_all_audio_files`, etc.

3. `Transcriber` class: Handles the transcription process using the Whisper LLM model from Hugging Face Transformers. It should have methods like `transcribe_audio`, `get_transcription_status`, etc.

4. `TranscriptionView` class: Handles the interaction with the user interface. It should have methods like `upload_audio_file`, `display_audio_files`, `display_transcription_status`, etc.

Now, let's start implementing the code.
