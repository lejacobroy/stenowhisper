Transcribe audio for court stenographers.
Use a python backend with MVC components.
The transcribing python fonction should use the whisper llm model from hugging face transformers.
The view needs to manage a library of audio files, with upload function and track the transcribe process status.
The resulting transcribed text should be in simple text format.
Please implement also the html and js necessary to interact with the backend.
